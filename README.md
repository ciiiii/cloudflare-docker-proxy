## Routes configuration tutorial

1. use cloudflare worker host: only support proxy one registry
   ```javascript
   const routes = {
     "${workername}.${username}.workers.dev/": "https://registry-1.docker.io",
   };
   ```
2. use custom domain: support proxy multiple registries route by host
   - host your domain DNS on cloudflare
   - add `A` record of xxx.example.com to `192.0.2.1`
   - deploy this project to cloudflare workers
   - add `xxx.example.com/*` to HTTP routes of workers
   - add more records and modify the config as you need
   ```javascript
   const routes = {
     "docker.libcuda.so": "https://registry-1.docker.io",
     "quay.libcuda.so": "https://quay.io",
     "gcr.libcuda.so": "https://k8s.gcr.io",
     "k8s-gcr.libcuda.so": "https://k8s.gcr.io",
     "ghcr.libcuda.so": "https://ghcr.io",
   };
   ```
